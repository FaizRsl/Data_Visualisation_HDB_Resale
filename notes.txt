Follow Gestalt Principles in Data Visualisation
- Proximity: Closer is together
- Similarity: Birds of a feather flock toghether
- Simplicity: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- Connectedness: Close links bonds
- Enclosure: Feeling boxed in
- Continuity: It cannot change so quickly
- Symmetry: Seeing both sides
- Figure-ground: Standing out from the crowd

Also the pyschological principles of effective graphics
- Principle of relevance: The Goldilocks principle
- Principle of appropriate knowledge
- Principle of salience: Attention to the important
- Principle of discriminability: Maintain a good contrast
- Principle of perceptual organisation: Making visual sense
- Principle of compatability: Saying the same thing
- Principle of information changes: Meaningful changes
- Principle of capacity limitation: Too much means only a little

Question to ask about dataset
1) does the town areas affect the pricing?
2) which period of time does price increase the most?
3) What is the distribution of housing prices based on different room types (1-room, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room, 5-room, etc.)? Are there any noticeable trends or anomalies in pricing for specific room types?
4) Is there any correlation between the year of completion and housing prices? Do more recently completed buildings tend to have higher or lower prices?
5) What is the relationship between the maximum floor level and housing prices? Do properties on higher floors typically command higher prices?
6) How does the presence of commercial and residential units in a building impact housing prices? Are properties in mixed-use buildings more or less expensive than those in purely residential buildings?
7) Are there any differences in housing prices based on the presence of amenities like market hawker centers, multistorey carparks, or precinct pavilions in the vicinity?
8) Does the town or precinct of the building's construction contract have an influence on housing prices? Are there towns or precincts that consistently have higher or lower prices?
9) Can you identify any geographic patterns in housing prices based on the postal code or street name? Are certain areas consistently more expensive than others?
10) What is the distribution of rental prices for different room types (1-room, 2-room, 3-room, etc.)? Are there any areas where rental prices are notably higher or lower?
11) How do sales and rental prices compare for studio apartments? Are they more expensive to buy than to rent?
12) Are there any significant changes in housing prices over time? Can you identify any trends or seasonal variations in pricing?
13) How does the flat model (e.g., Improved, Model A, etc.) impact resale prices, and are certain flat models more desirable in the market?
14) Is there any seasonality in resale prices over time? Do prices tend to fluctuate throughout the year, and if so, when are they typically higher or lower?
15) Are there any outliers in the dataset that might indicate unusual resale prices? How can you identify and handle such outliers in your analysis?
